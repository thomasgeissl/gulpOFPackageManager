gulpOFPackageManager
===

Description
---
gulpOFPackageManager is a very experimental package manager for openFrameworks.
This is a work in progress and might undergo some changes.

I also plan to port this to oF.

Usage
---
Installation
####
* Clone this repo into your openFrameworks/scripts directory ```git clone https://github.com/thomasgeissl/gulpOFPackageManager.git /path/to/your/openFrameworks/scripts/gulpOFPackageManager```
* Install dependencies: ```cd /path/to/your/openFrameworks/scripts/gulpOFPackageManager && npm install```

Project management
####
* Clone dependencies: ```gulp --cwd /path/to/your/openFrameworks/scripts/gulpOFPackageManager clone```
* Checkout versions: ```gulp --cwd /path/to/your/openFrameworks/scripts/gulpOFPackageManager checkout```
* Search repo: ```gulp --cwd /path/to/your/openFrameworks/scripts/gulpOFPackageManager search --query ofxHttp```
* Install repo: ```gulp --cwd /path/to/your/openFrameworks/scripts/gulpOFPackageManager install --github bakercp/ofxHttp [--type lib]```

Example
---
The script parses an ofPackage.json file.
```js
{
	"addons": [{
		"url": "https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv.git",
		"checkout": "develop"
	}, {
		"url": "https://github.com/danomatika/ofxMidi.git",
		"checkout": "4e92269cf419d7cade46911fc0e768acd54e1969"
	}, {
		"github": "bakercp/ofxIO"
	}],
  "libs": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/nlohmann/json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Dependencies
---
* node.js

TODO:
---
* Make sure clone task is finished and add as dependencies for checkout task
* Install addon dependencies, need to parse addon_config.mk or add a json based addon config
* npm-like functionalities: install, installSave, uninstall, uninstallSave, ...
* Update/generate addons.make with local paths
* Delete local_addons and libs if already exist
* command line args for e.g. package file
* Use gulp-promt for interactive mode
